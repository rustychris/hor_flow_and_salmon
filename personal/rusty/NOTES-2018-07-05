Status of DFM sections:

figs-20180626-dfm:

Based on runs/hor_003
 that has Old_River ssh 1.5m
 SJ ssh 1.55
 SJ upstream Q=210

Tran 1: mean vel: 0.6 (dfm) 0.7 (adcp)
  seems that the ADCP shows less vertical shear, and more horizontal shear
  max velocity in ADCP clearly much larger than max of DFM
  the little bit of secondary that's measured is also in DFM.

Tran 2: similar.

UnTRIM seems to get the lateral shear much better, based on these earlier
transects. 

What did Ed use for friction?
  CD_max=0.2
  -10 m => z0=1e-4
   -8 m => z0=2e-4
   -4 m => z0=1e-3
   +1 m => z0=4e-3

Compared to my DFM run - 0.023 uniform manning n, 5e-05 baseline eddy viscosity for vertical.
 Horizontal viscosity set to 1m2/s, probably too large.
  => change to 0.1
  

Ed suggests forcing the flow split with a downstream Q on San Joaquin

Is it worth it to do a more quantitative comparison against the transects?
